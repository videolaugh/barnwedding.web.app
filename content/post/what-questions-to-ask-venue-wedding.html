        <h3>If Not, Do You Have A Preferred Vendor List We Can Review?</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Can you provide a list? An obvious point, yes but knowing if your search entails 1 or 2. What overnight accommodations do you provide?</p>
        <h3>If Not, What Other Dates Are Available?</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>If they do not have your date, you will need to decide if you would like to cross the venue off your list or consider changing your wedding date. When can we start decorating the venue? This should always be your first question.</p>
        <h3>What Is The Pricing Chart For These Shortlisted Dates?</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>How many guests can the venue accommodate? Is the venue available on the day of my wedding? What other events are going on at the venue on the same day?</p>
        <h3>A Very Important Question To Ask Your Wedding Venue At The Final Meeting Is “When Is The Final Payment Due?” Furthermore, You Will Want To Know What Their Refund Policy Is In Case Of A Change Of The Wedding Date Or Cancelation.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Are there any suites or private rooms available to get ready or have alone time? Night, standing (the cocktail hour), sitting (ceremony and dinner), and in the specific spaces. If they do have your date available, great!</p>
        <h3>Can I Have Your Wedding Packages?</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The first question you need to ask yourself is how many venues will you need for your wedding day, do you want a venue to host both you ceremony and reception or would you prefer a church ceremony with the party in a completely different setting. The first destination wedding question to ask is the size of venues available for your special day. How much is the booking deposit?</p>
