    <p>It was the fabulous appleton roebuck scarecrow weekend 2nd &amp; 3rd july! First of all, when the wedding car has arrived in appleton roebuck for the departure (about 15 minutes early) and providing the distance in not too great to the ceremony in north yorkshire or further afield, we would undertake a single trip to the ceremony for the bridesmaids or other members of the family to the ceremony.
