        <h3>The Actual Cost Will Be Shared With The Client At A Later Stage;</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>#1 the average cost for a uk wedding is £31,974 (manchester evening news) the average cost of a wedding in the uk is £31,974—a £299 decrease from the previous year. The current average cost of a u.k wedding excluding the cost of the honeymoon is £26,989. That’s an increase of around £5,000 from 2017, but it does include the ring and the honeymoon.</p>
        <h3>It’s An Expensive Time For Sure, And Any Ways Of Potentially Lowering The Cost Without Compromising On The Experience, Should Surely Be Looked At.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Below we&#039;ve shown the average cost from a selection of wedding websites. Most farm or barn wedding venues cost between $5,989 and $12,341 according to value penguin ’s research. It&#039;s worth keeping in mind that wedding costs can vary wildly from london to wales, or somerset to scotland, (which is why we&#039;ve given you such broad price ranges), but for couples who opt for &#039;the works&#039; on their wedding day, it&#039;s expected to come in at just over £30,000.</p>
        <h3>As Well As Your Main Marquee You Need A Smaller Annexe For The Caterers.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Food and drink costs are dependent on stock availability and supplier costs Standard chairs are £4 a chair with more contemporary trendy ones at £12 per chair. If you find a barn venue with bathrooms, consider booking it.</p>
        <h3>Furniture Can Be How Long Is A Piece Of String!</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>Surveying more than 2,000 british couples who held weddings the previous year, the research sought to uncover actual spend rather than intended spend for a more accurate representation of the weddings market. When you&#039;re allocating your wedding budget, wedding catering prices will be a big part of your overall spend. Depending on which website you look at, the average uk wedding cost ranges from £10,000 to £28,000.</p>
        <h3>But It&#039;s Not Always Easy To Understand The Costs.</h3>
    <br/>
    <p>The data in the report shows that the current average cost of a wedding in the u.k is now 16,005, compared to last year’s average cost of £15,171. #2 the cost of a wedding increased by £5,000 in a decade (statista) By premier carriage, 28th june, 2015.</p>
